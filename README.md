# Windows Security Details Extension

**Intro**

I made this plugin because we use OCS-Inventory in our company for computer monitoring and management with AD and other Windows services.
We wanted to improve our security by gathering security data about the computers in our company and we couldn't find a plugin to match our criteria, we tested many. This is why I'm making this plugin for us and for everyone to use freely.
